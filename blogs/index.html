        <article>
          <p>
            Taking the first step of a long journey. Today, I'll talk to you
            about why I'm starting my blog while learning Front-end development.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Introduce myself to the web</li>
            <li>Become a better writer/ communicator</li>
            <li>A good first project</li>
            <li>Store my learning process</li>
            <li>Share resources</li>
            <li>Help others on their journey</li>
            <li>Motivation/ community</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Let me introduce myself quickly. My name is Nicholas Bérubé from
            Québec, Canada. I grew up in a family of seven kids in Mirabel. I
            learned English as my first language in elementary school and french
            afterward in high school. Learning both languages quickly became
            both a perk and a headache. Writing has always been one of my
            weaknesses, thus the creation of this blog. More on this later.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently working as a forestry technician in the Lanaudière
            region. I've been working outdoors for a couple of years now.
            Looking to make a career change, I have tried learning web
            development in the past, but it has always been "on" and "off". I
            was always interested and curious about computers and the web so web
            development made sense. I also enjoy video games and music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning front-end development is the path I've decided to follow.
            I'm currently on what I think is my personal "best approach" to
            sticking with it. Hopefully, you enjoy reading this and I’ll see you
            again in my next blog posts.
          </p>
          <h3>Why I am writing a blog</h3>
          <p>
            Like I mentioned earlier, writing is not something that feels easy
            to me. Hopefully writing more often will help me achieve greater
            writing skills and open up new doors for me. Writing will help me
            both be a better oral communicator and make writing less of a hassle
            (It shouldn't have to be one). I also think sharing my achievements
            and struggles will maybe help an aspiring developer who will stumble
            on my blog in the future stay motivated. Being part of the dev
            community and contributing is a rewarding feeling. I like reading
            other's blogs as I can often relate to some aspects and understand
            my struggles better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making tutorials is something I envision doing once I am more
            comfortable with the subjects I want to teach. Writing and
            publishing will also help me virtually store my learning process for
            future reference. I might start making some soon as I have read that
            explaining simple topics and making it understandable to anyone
            helps "anchor" the knowledge better.
          </p>
          <p>Some topics I would like to discuss are:</p>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>How the web works</li>
            <li>How does a browser work</li>
            <li>Basic HTML</li>
            <li>Basic CSS</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I will start with these and see where they lead me. Stay tuned!</p>
          <h3>Resources</h3>
          <p>
            Lastly, I want to share some resources that I think are invaluable
            for anyone interested in learning web development. Most of these are
            completely newbie-friendly. I hope you like them and let me know if
            I missed some that are worth mentioning.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
            <li>Front-end masters</li>
            <li>CSS tricks</li>
            <li>Stack overflow</li>
            <li>Google</li>
            <li>Cheatsheets (HTML, CSS, JS)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I hope you enjoyed this short first blog post and feel free to email
            me questions and comments. I am always open to discussing with other
            'devs'.
